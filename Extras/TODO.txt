TODO: 
I want to simplify javascript code for React.
I want to create comments to explain the code to others to help them understand the code.


User Stories:

As an employee, I want to request off for a date range but exclude a day, 
for example: I want October 8, October 9, October 10, October 12 off. 
I do not want October 11 off.
I want to submit a single request for this range and exclude one day. As opposed to two requests.
so that I can make less effort.
But, I also want to link this range of four days off, 1 day on, 5 total days, together,
so that if I cannot get October 12 off, I do not want October 8, October 9, October 10 off.

As a manager, I want to select a specific day from a range of days that the employee cannot request off,
so that the employee will know what day(s) are unavailable to request off. I want the employee to know that 
they CAN request off these other days, just not this specific day in the range of days.
